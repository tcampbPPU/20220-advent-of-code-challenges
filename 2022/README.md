# Advent of Code 2022

My PHP Solutions for [http://adventofcode.com](http://adventofcode.com) 2022

I write these in [Tinkerwell](https://tinkerwell.app/) then copy them here in repo. This is dependent on a few helpers from Laravel, so you'll if you are trying to run these you'll might to run in tinker or execute them with Laravel artisan tinker executable.

Each day is in a separate folder, and each day has a `README.md` with the problem description and, there is a `1.php` and `2.php` for each question. There is also a `data` folder with a `input.txt` file with the input for the day. Some days have a `example.txt` file with the test input.

Some days I messed around with GO, Bash and other languages. Those are in the `other` folder.
